# Loss_function_tutorial
As part of my term work I had to investigate the topic of neural networks, and more specifically: to deal with loss functions.
 
The objectives of the work were to write training materials on the loss functions Abs, MSE, SmoothL1, CrossEntropy, BCE for neural network platform PuzzleLib.

For writing tutorials I needed to study regression and classification problems, for which neural networks are used. Also to understand the essence of use, to understand the device, to give examples of work, to make a comparative analysis of loss functions and to write tutorials.
